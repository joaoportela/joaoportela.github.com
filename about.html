  <p>
    Jo達o workds at <a href="http://abyssal.eu">Abyssal SA</a>. When he's not 
    doing that, he's lurking around the internet reading about 3d rendering, 
    physics simulation, software development or programming in general;
    from time to time he assumes the role of a content producer instead of just
    a lurker, creating small pieces of <a href="https://github.com/joaoportela">
    software on github</a> or helping people on 
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/86845/joao-portela">stackoverflow</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    He also likes to play computer games and Dungeons & Dragons.
  </p>
  <p>
    He is also not sure if <a href="http://youtu.be/XP9pnSXhibw?t=4m41s">
    writing in third person is working</a> as expected. :)
